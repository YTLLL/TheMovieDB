# MovieDB Project

This app will be able to report information on a movie that the user searches. 
The types of information that will be returned to the user are: movie title, overview, 
release date, original language, popularity, average rating, adult rating, and 
production companies. This list will be subject to change. The people who will most likely
use this information are avid movie fans who want to know a bit more about what they 
are watching. Other features will include a compare capability that will compare to or more
movies side by side, and a save function to save your favorite movies. As we go on, we may try 
to add some features. We plan to use bootstrap for now to style our app.


We will be using [the Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
